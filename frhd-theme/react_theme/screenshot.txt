To complete the theme, you should create a screenshot.png file in the theme root directory with the following specifications:

1. Image size: 1200x900 pixels
2. Format: PNG
3. Content: A visual representation of your theme showing the blog layout with React logo

You can use the HTML file (screenshot.html) provided in this package as a reference to capture a screenshot.

The recommended approach is:
1. Set up a local WordPress installation
2. Install and activate this theme
3. Add some sample posts
4. Take a screenshot of the homepage
5. Resize to 1200x900 pixels
6. Save as screenshot.png in the theme root directory
